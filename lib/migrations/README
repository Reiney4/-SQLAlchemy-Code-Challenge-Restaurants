#  SQLAlchemy Code Challenge: Restaurants

## Introduction

This repo contains code for a restaurant review system for restuarants-code-challenge-sqlalchemy based on python classes and instances, class and instance methods, variable scope, object relationships, and lists and list methods working with  sqlalchmy.

This project utilizes the `pytest` library for testing purposes. The `pytest framework` makes it easy to write small, readable tests, and can scale to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.

*The test suite encompases all deliverables for this code challenge. All tests should be passing.*
